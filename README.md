#Rename-Photos
This is a Python script that will rename photo files in a directory per user input.

###How It Works:

1. Asks users to select a program from a pre-populated list.
2. Asks user to select a movie.
3. Asks user for the directory containing the photos.
4. Asks user for the desired filename.

The script will rename all the files in the directory and append a number to the end, starting from 1, e.g., file_name_1, file_name_2, etc.

This script was written for use at the Coral Gables Art Cinema in South Florida. As such, the initial program directories are hard-coded into the script in order to save the user time.
